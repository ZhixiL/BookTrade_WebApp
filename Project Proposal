1. Project Title
FSU Textbook Trading Web App
2. Brief overview of what you are proposing
What we are trying to accomplish is to establish a web application where FSU students 
can trade textbooks on easily and efficiently.
3. Motivation
As college students, we buy a lot of textbooks, but most of the textbooks were only needed for
a single semester. Therefore for the purpose of reusing these resources and also decrease the money
wasted on buying expensive textbooks, we want to make a website where people can trade their textbook.
