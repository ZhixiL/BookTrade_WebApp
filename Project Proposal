1. Project Title
FSU Textbook Trading Web App

2. Brief overview of what you are proposing
What we are trying to accomplish is to establish a web application where FSU students 
can trade textbooks on easily and efficiently.

3. Motivation
As college students, we buy a lot of textbooks, but most of the textbooks were only needed for
a single semester. Therefore for the purpose of reusing these resources and also decrease the money
wasted on buying expensive textbooks, we want to make a website where people can trade their textbook.

4. Features to be implemented and types of users
- Target user - FSU students
***Feature***
- Chatbox where buyer and seller could communicate with each other immediately
- Database to store the textbooks that people posts
- Account system for security reason
- Search function for people to quickly find if there's a textbook they want
- Adding a module where people can post and take down buy orders for specific textbooks
- Sending emails to people for reminders

5. Risk / Challenges
- Risk - User information breach from improper handeling of account system
- Potential Risk - Copyright issue
- Challenge - Learning curve from using python, database, API, etc.
- Challenge - Potentially need to learn CSS, HTML, or Javascript
- Challenge - interact with email might be difficult

6. Exisitng related projects
