1. Project Title
FSU Textbook Trading Web App

2. Brief overview of what you are proposing
What we are trying to accomplish is to establish a web application where FSU students 
can trade textbooks on easily and efficiently.

3. Motivation
As college students, we buy a lot of textbooks, but most of the textbooks were only needed for
a single semester. Therefore for the purpose of reusing these resources and also decrease the money
wasted on buying expensive textbooks, we want to make a website where people can trade their textbook.

4. Features to be implemented and types of users
- Target user - FSU students
***Feature***
- Chatbox where buyer and seller could communicate with each other immediately
- Database to store the textbooks that people posts
- Account system for security reason
- Search function for people to quickly find if there's a textbook they want
- Adding a module where people can post and take down buy orders for specific textbooks
- Sending emails to people for reminders

5. Risk / Challenges
- Risk - User information breach from improper handeling of account system
- Potential Risk - Copyright issue
- Challenge - Learning curve from using python, database, API, etc.
- Challenge - Potentially need to learn CSS, HTML, or Javascript
- Challenge - interact with email might be difficult

6. Exisitng related projects
https://student2student.com
This website supports selling and price comparison of textbooks.
Our web app is different from the student2student web where our app will be intended only for fsu students.

7. Intended platform / programming language
Platform - Web Application
Programming Language - Mainly python, potentially CSS, HTML, or Javascirpt

8. Third-party libraries / APIs to be used
Django: it provides a standalone web server for the users to test their apps

9. Team members, expertise, project responsibilities, and team organization
